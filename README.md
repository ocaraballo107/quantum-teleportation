# Quantum Teleportation using Qiskit

This Python script demonstrates quantum teleportation using Qiskit, a framework for working with quantum computers. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory that allows the transfer of quantum states from one location to another through the use of entanglement and classical communication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html): The quantum computing framework used in this script.

You can install Qiskit using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

## Code Explanation

The provided code demonstrates the quantum teleportation protocol in Qiskit using a series of functions and steps. Here's a breakdown of the code's components:

### `create_bell_pair(qc, a, b)`

This function creates an entangled Bell pair between two qubits. It applies a Hadamard gate (`qc.h()`) to qubit `a` and then performs a controlled-X gate (`qc.cx(a, b)`) to entangle qubit `a` and `b`.

### `teleport(qc, psi, a, b)`

This function implements the quantum teleportation protocol. It takes the input state `psi` and two qubits `a` and `b` as arguments. The teleportation process involves a series of quantum gates and measurements:

1. Apply a controlled-X gate (`qc.cx(psi, a)`) to entangle `psi` and Alice's qubit (`a`).
2. Apply a Hadamard gate (`qc.h(psi)`) to `psi`.
3. Insert a barrier in the circuit for clarity (`qc.barrier()`).
4. Measure qubits `psi` and `a`.
5. Insert another barrier.
6. Apply controlled-X gate (`qc.cx(a, b)`) and controlled-Z gate (`qc.cz(psi, b)`) to Bob's qubit (`b`).

### `main()`

This is the main function where the quantum teleportation process is orchestrated:

1. Create a quantum circuit with 3 qubits and 3 classical bits (`qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)`).
2. Prepare the state to be teleported (`psi`) by applying an X gate to it (`qc.x(psi)`).
3. Create the entangled Bell pair between Alice's and Bob's qubits (`create_bell_pair(qc, 1, 2)`).
4. Teleport the state `psi` to Bob's qubit using the `teleport` function.
5. Measure the qubits and extract the measurement result.
6. Run the quantum circuit using a simulator backend and print the teleportation result.

## Running the Code

To run the code, make sure you have Qiskit installed and then execute the script:

```bash
python teleportation.py
```

You should see the teleportation result in terms of counts of different measurement outcomes.

## Note

This code is designed to demonstrate the basic principles of quantum teleportation. In a real-world quantum computing environment, various optimizations and error-correcting techniques would be necessary.
